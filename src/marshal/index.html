        </ul>
        <p>We set out to build a cloud-based privacy tool that could find and alert people to sensitive data in their cloud. During the alpha, we learned some critical lessons including that customers didn't want yet another service having access to and/or storing copies of their data — especially if it was found to contain sensitive information. The beta was a security product which could parse files on-the-fly without data ever being copied or resting on disk.</p>

        <p>We wanted a brand that would exude confidence without being overbearing. The name, logo, and palette were designed to evoke the following emotions:</p>
        <ul class="tags-stylized">
          <li class="tag">Secure</li>
          <li class="tag">Trustworthy</li>
          <li class="tag">Approachable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The result is a product brand that is consumer friendly but powerful in presence. The name sounds like a person while also denoting safety. The logo is strong and angled but constructed with simple and pleasing geometric shapes. The color palette is functional and flexible.</p>
