        <p>I joined Meta as the design lead for the Facebook Incubator. I oversaw design for all Incubator products, developed 0-1 strategies, promoted best practices, and mentored colleagues across disciplines. I collaborated vertically with pillars to identify and validate new incubation opportunities, and horizontally with the design leadership council to staff and ship the highest priority projects. I led two major initiatives, managed multiple sprints, and joined a hackathon. My efforts doubled design system adoption and improved product quality.</p>

        <h4>Short-Form Video</h4>
        <p>A majority of my tenure focused on Short-Form Video (SFV). I worked across Facebook and Instagram to integrate Reels into Groups, ensuring they thrived in communities through projects like attribution, chaining, and resharing. I led design for a major initiative, recruiting and directing dozens of designers from across the company. This effort identified and implemented numerous enhancements that were immediately shipped to increase user-generated content, expand reach, boost interaction, and support unification efforts.</p>

        <h4>Visions</h4>
        <p>I was expected to push teams to pursue <em>what they thought they should</em> rather than <em>what they thought they could</em>. I joined teams exploring themes such as product hacking, fitness, motivation, and connection. In a hybrid product/design capacity, I isolated the best starting tests, crafted initial specs, designed visions, and provided clear iteration paths. My efforts set teams up for success, leading to several successful product launches and aligning new products with our most important horizontal efforts.</p>

        <h4>Quality</h4>
        <ul class="tags">
          <li class="tag">Product Manager</li>
          <li class="tag">Principal Designer</li>
          <li class="tag credit">Designed with John MacMenamin</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I defined new metrics that enabled us to quantify quality. I moved the needle by evangelizing best practices, incorporating linting into our design reviews, and automating the bug filing process. These changes incentivized colleagues to leverage existing components and more actively participate in bug reporting during alphas/betas. My efforts increased design quality by 100%.</p>
        <p>To further boost quality improvements, I built an extension to the Facebook Design System to power a new Figma starter file. This empowered colleagues to create internally branded Figma projects with consistent structures, flows, and statuses in a matter of seconds.</p>

Our team explored new ways to foster both explicit and implicit connections. This effort generated tons of ideas, culminating with me designing concepts like ice breakers, subgroups, and mutual messaging.</p>
