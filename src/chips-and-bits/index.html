        <p>Since 2010, I have been the co-host of Chips & Bits. What started as a side project with a friend, blossomed into a monthly labour of love. In addition to co-hosting duties, I also handle the design side of the house.</p>

        <p>We wanted the podcast to be as accessible as possible. The website provides a place where anyone in the world can listen to the podcast without forcing them to use a mobile device or podcast app. It also provides a place for us to further engage our audience through timestamped notes.</p>
