        <p>I was contracted by Carlos Lamas as he was preparing to break out on his own. He was looking for a brand he could work under and a reel site to both showcase his work and build his customer base.</p>

        <h4>Website</h4>
        <ul class="tags">
          <li class="tag">Principal Designer</li>
          <li class="tag">Front-End Developer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Carlos wanted a simple site where his work was the focus. He was also keen on maintaining the site himself. I designed a glorified video player backed by Vimeo which can be updated via semantic HTML that auto-deploys to GitHub Pages. The website launched his freelance career and established him as one of the premier video editors in the Twin Cities. Carlos loves purple.</p>
